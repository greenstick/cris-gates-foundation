							Prior to the selection of indicators, the district identifies its<br>

							different groups of students (e.g. by achievement level). It<br>
							taks stock of its available resources, challenges, and needs<br>
							and prioritizes actions to take. A parallel process occurs at the<br>
							school level, where each school takes stock of the<br>
							demographics and achievement of their current and prior<br>
							population of students and related needs and prioritizes<br>
							actions. With this information, the district or school can<br>

					The College Readiness Indicator Systems (CRIS) framework articulates the interrelated components that make up an effective college<br>
					readiness indicator system.
					<br><br>
					The CRIS initiative, sponsored by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed to develop and study the implementation of a system of<br>
					signals and supports designed to increase the number of students who graduate from high school ready to succeed in college. Three<br>
					research organizations - the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and<br>
					Their Communities at Stanford University, and the University of Chicago Consortium on Chicago School Research - partnered with four<br>
					urban school districts and one school support network to conduct the initiative.
					<br><br>
					<a href="" target="_blank">Please see the six-part CRIS Resource Series for a more detailed account of our research.</a>

						<li>Indicators to target three distinct yet interdependent college readiness dimensions: <span class="bold">Academic</span><br>
						<span class="bold">Preparedness, College Knowledge, and Academic Tenacity;</span></li>
						<li>A tri-level approach premised on the idea that an effective set of indicators generates data that<br>
						reflect activities, processes, and outcomes at the <span class="bold">individual (student), setting (school),</span> and <span class="bold">system<span><br>
						<span class="bold">(district and partners) levels</span>; and</li>
						<li>A <span class="bold">Cycle of Inquiry</span> that connects indicators for each dimension and at each level with the<br>
